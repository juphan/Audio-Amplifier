# Audio-Amplifier
This audio amplifier circuit was designed to allow the user to physically change the volume of a plugged-in phone (or music player) by turning the dial of a dual gauge potentiometer. A phone can be connected in series with the potentiometer and the circuit on the board to serve as the source of audio. The circuit will be connected to a wall outlet and be powered by dampening AC voltage into DC voltage. A pair of headphones can be connected to the board to hear the amplified audio. 

The circuit design was taken from a schematic. This schematic was re-created on Eagle and board layout was performed on a 3x3 inch board. This project mainly involved setting up a circuit, basic board layout, ordering components, and soldering through hole parts.

*Note - There is a small design issue. A female pin connector was not included for the ground pin of the potentiometer. However, this issue can be solved by manually connecting the ground pin of the potentiometer with another ground in the circuit.
